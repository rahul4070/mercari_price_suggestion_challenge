## Introduction:-
People often in there life come across a situation where they want to sell a product(old or new) but don’t get buyers or the situation may be the other way around where they want to buy the product at a lower price but doesn’t get the seller.
So in order to deal with this situation, we have OLX and Quickr in India where the person can sell or buy products provided the product is available at the right price.
Mercari is a Japanese US-based online marketplace where the person can sell or buy almost anything online, just like we have OLX and Quickr in India.
But the question that struck our mind is: who decides the right price ??
Mercari hosted a competition on Kaggle by the name “Mercari Price Suggestion Challenge” where given some product details(other than images) they want us to come up with the right price predictions. It would also give us a basic intuition provided how the price prediction takes place in sites like OLX and Quickr

So you would get the code details above but if you want to see how I approached this problem than you can read my blog:- https://medium.com/@rahulBisht40/mercari-price-suggestion-problem-e5e6bdf1f1fd
